## Welcome to my attempt at JavaScript30 Challenge

This challenge is a way to practice our fundamental understanding of JavaScript by creating 30 different project in 30 days with Vanilla JavaScript.

### Here are the project that I've built
1. [JS Drum Kit](https://richodainino.github.io/JavaScript30/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/)
